      <h3>Software Development</h3>
      <p>Software development holds a critical space in the 4th revolution of our world. I am quite excited to find myself
        in this space. I studied Computer Information Systems at Babcock University, Ogun State, Nigeria and graduated in 2013. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience in developing IT solutions.

      <h3>Nutrition & Healthy Lifestyle</h3>
      <p>My personal secret formula is and remains, Rest, Exercise and Diet (R.E.D). As a team director in a multinational health and wellness company (Neolife) and over 4 years of experience as a trained nutritionist, I talk the
        talk and walk the walk; holding corporate health presentations and public health campaigns within and around the south western states of Nigeria.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>Music was a big influence to shaping my thoughts as a child both spiritually and socially. It's not going to change.
        So it's important to be selective of the music that inspires one. Thanfully, i make my own as well. As a music producer, FL Studio is my DAW of choice and hiphop/rap is my favourite music genre.
