<p><em><strong>Key Accomplishment in any two roles:</strong></em></p>
1.	Date: June, 2017<br>

Position: Chief Operating Officer (COO)<br>

Organization: Xenderston Concepts Ltd.<br>

<u>Key Accomplishment:</u> <br>
 I reorganized the company’s payment structure and created a hierarchical system company structure. With this structure, we were able to really understand and see for ourselves the areas we were lacking in terms of man power as well as areas that we didn’t need to have within our system.

2.	Date: January, 2016<br>

Position: Chief Operating Officer (COO)<br>

Organization: SOMAFAM Global Concepts<br>

<u>Key Accomplishment: </u><br>
 I took over an already existing but dormant company and turned it into a well-oiled functioning machine. As the only staff, I took on the role of single handedly carrying out tasks systemically and as a result created value for my clients. From a dormant company, through good work, I generated profit.
